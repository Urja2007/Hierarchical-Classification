This project focuses on hierarchical classification of satellite images using the EuroSAT dataset. It explores different models (e.g., classical ML models, CNNs like AlexNet) and experiments with spectral variants such as:

RGB (3-band) classification

All 13 spectral bands classification

The goal is not just flat classification but attempting structured classification workflows (e.g., from broad to fine categories).
